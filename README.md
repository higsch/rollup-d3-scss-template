## Getting started

git clone https://github.com/higsch/rollup-d3-scss-template
cd rollup-d3-scss-template
npm install

# or
npx degit "higsch/rollup-d3-scss-template" my-app
cd my-app

`npm run build` builds the application to `public/bundle.js`, along with a sourcemap file for debugging.

`npm start` launches a server, using [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve). Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

`npm run watch` will continually rebuild the application as your source files change.

`npm run dev` will run `npm start` and `npm run watch` in parallel.
